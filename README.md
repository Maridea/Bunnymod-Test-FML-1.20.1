This is just a mod for Minecraft I have been making in order to learn forge modding for 1.20

This mod will not be published to to the general public officially, and this mod should only be looked at as a visual indicator of my progress

Most of the content in this mod is derived from Modding by Kaupenjoe's Minecraft Forge 1.20 modding guides, with the link to such being https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55qUIf3GMss&list=PLKGarocXCE1H9Y21-pxjt5Pt8bW14twa-
Some minor amounts of original content exists in this mod, as a way to apply what I learn to something separate from the direct tutorial 
Any full and interesting original content may be added to it's own mod in the future for fun, as I would love to create and share mods in the future
